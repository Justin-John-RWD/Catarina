<h3>Update-January 9, 2012</h3>
<small>

<b><font color="black">On November 18, 2011, following "Orders from Above"</font></b> the Appeals Court of Masaya, that had already upheld the Rights of Dominion and Posession of Justin Dobson and his wife in two prior cases, over-turned a (2010) lower court (District) ruling, in direct violation of the Constitution of Nicaragua, the Law of Municipalities of Nicaragua and Logic, and instructed the Public Registry to Cancel the inscription of Title Transfer in the names of Mr Dobson and his wife.<br><br> 

Sources within the Masaya Court and the Supreme Court had previously warned that a certain Supreme Court Magistrate, infamous for her role as Daniel Ortega's "flunky" in toying with ex-President Arnoldo Aleman, was instructing the Masaya Magistrates to rule against Mr Dobson and his wife.<br><br> 
<font color="black">This is Manufacured Sentence Designed to Legitimize or Cover up a Theft</font> <br>

<ul> 
<li>Violates the Constitution when it applies law that was Repealed and Superceded.</li>

<li>Violates the Constitution by stating that the Procurator General of the Rebublic (PGR) "Subsumes" representation of the Municipality of Catarina, two autonomous entities</li>

<li>Applies a law (repealed) that was specific and did not apply to Agrarian Reform titles</li>

<li>Ignores all prior cases and evidence including a signed constancia from the Ministry of Property upholding the title and its succesors</li>

<li>States that since there is construction on the property it must be protected - the very same that was financed by the Austrian Development Corporation, financing that they cut off following an investigation</li> 

</ul>

The objective of this web site is to Document and Publicise the story of a Land Dispute that is on-going since 2001.</p>
<p>It's a story about a foreign investor in Nicaragua fighting, so far successfully, for his rights against corrupt functionaries of a local council (Alcaldia) and the local courts bent on using fraud, influence, abuse of authority and violence in order to steal a parcel of land that has Tourism Potencial.<br />
<br />

This site provides a history of the dispute, from the original Assignment of Title by 
the Nicaraguan Government and the subsequent Fraudulent attempt at land legalisation, 
through three (3) civil court cases, including intervention by the current Nicaraguan Government under Daniel Ortega. 
It describes and documents the Fraud, Violence and Abuse of Power that functionaries of the Council (Alcaldia) have resorted to in an effort to pervert the property registration system and the course of justice.

</p>

<p>We hope you find this site both Interesting and Informative. It should be useful to those 
who are thinking of investing in Nicaragua and those who are already here and perhaps are having 
problems and have lost confidence. It's actually a positive story in that, so far, the "Baddies" have not won!
</p>
<p>Any comments, either in support or against the position taken in this web-site, will be gracefully received either in the Blog (Public) or by sending a Contact form (private).</p>
<p>Enough said, on to <a href="thestory-1.htm">The Story</a></p>
