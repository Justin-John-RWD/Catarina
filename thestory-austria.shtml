<h3>Austrian Development Corporation Finances Illegal Construction</h3>
<p>During 2007, while in the middle of a lawsuit to evict them from Private Property, the Alcaldia of Catarina promoted the development of a project to develop a new Mirador (look-out). The alcaldia solicited around US$200,000 from the Austrian Development Corporation (ADC), and began construction within the boundaries of a private Property that was the subject of an on-going lawsuit seeking eviction of the Alcaldia.  Sources within the Alcaldia suggest that the objective was "to change the situation on the ground, while involving international organizations as financiers", a situation that would make it more difficult (politically thereby judicially) to return the land to the rightful owners, regardless of any court order to do so.
This activity was recorded during an on-site inspection by the District Judge of Masaya and is documented in the court records.<br />

A meeting was held in the offices of the ADC between Justin Dobson with his attorney and the then Nicaragua Country Director for the Austrian Development Corporation, a Ms. Michaela Ellmeier. At the meeting Mr Dobson presented Ms Ellmeier with Court Certified documents showing that the land in which the construction was occurring was Private property belonging to Mr Dobson and his wife, that the Alcaldia had already lost a previous lawsuit on this point and that it was subject to an on-going lawsuit to evict the Alcaldia.  Mr Dobson requested that Ms Ellmeier conduct a review of their "due dilligence" and determine how it was that the ADC approved funding for an illegal project that was undermining his rights. Ms Ellmeier agreed.  A few days later Mr Dobson receieved an e-mail from Ms Ellmeier in which she stated that she had ordered a review of the project and that it would be carried out by the assigned Project Manager (a Mr Yader Baldizon) and the ADC's in-house Attorney (Ms. Mercedes Caceres) - the very same people who were responsible for the Due Dilligence process initially.  Ms Ellmeier's faith in her employees suggest a certain naivety within the Austrian Government as to how corruption works in Nicaragua.
<br>  

The investigation and subsequent report, which took almost 2 months to prepare, relied solely on verbal claims by the Alcaldia and glares in the face of Official Court Records.<br/>  The Findings of the report state that the project construction financed by the Austrian Development Corporation involves separate properties from the property in dispute. The report goes on to state Property Registry data which are affected - both supposedly owned by the Alcaldia.  A subsequent check on these properties show that they are indeed affected by the construction but only because the footpath to the new Mirador passes through them. The report fails to review the claim by Mr Dobson that the construction of the actual Mirador is occurring within his property as is certified by the On-Site inspection carried out by the District Judge of Masaya.<br>

The Report (Click to read

<a 
   href="http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=es&tl=en&u=Faustria-report.htm" 
   onClick="return popup(this, 'notes')">English Translation</a>) was published as a half-page Word document, without title and without mention of the authors.<br/><br/>

Following their release of the report, the ADC has refused to discuss the matter further and, indeed, has ignored all attempts at communication. They have even ignored the subsequent issuence of a Final Court Sentence for Eviction and Restitution of the property.<br/>
While the initial funding of the project might be excused as a failure in Due Dilligence, the Austrian Government, by Ignoring the Court Sentences and continuing the funding of the project, is a willfully supporting the perpetration of fraud, corruption and other illegal acts in Nicaragua.<br/><br>
Ms Ellmeier has since been withdrawn from Nicaragua.<br>
Construction of the new Mirador has ceased.  The project is incomplete (an eye-sore) and is currently patronised by drunks and prostitutes.<br><br>
To all Austrians...  Happy about how your Government is spending your Taxes?
